    Shibboleth Game Engine
==============================

Shibboleth is my pet project at developing a fully featured game engine. Shibboleth comes in two parts,
a simple application framework and the engine itself. Essentially, the game engine portion is just extensions
of the application framework.

=============
    GOALS
=============

The primary goal is to develop a game engine and editor that is highly extensible and as data driven
as possible (where it makes sense).
